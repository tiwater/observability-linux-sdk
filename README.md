# Ticos Linux SDK

Ship hardware products at the speed of software. With Ticos, you can
continuously monitor devices, debug firmware issues, and deploy OTA updates to
your fleet.

## Overview

The Ticos Linux SDK consists of a combination of existing open-source
software and a daemon [`ticosd`][source-ticosd] that orchestrates and
configures it. It also implements additional features such as tracking of reboot
reason tracking, and in the future reporting crashes and logs.

To provide core Ticos platform features, the Ticos Linux SDK relies on
well-established, battle-tested open-source software. The daemon `ticosd`
implements Ticos-specific features and also acts as a configuration agent.

## Prerequisites

Even though support for a broader diversity of setups is planned, this first
versions of our SDK makes the following assumptions:

- Your project uses [Yocto][yocto-homepage] as a build system.
- It uses [systemd][systemd-homepage] as an init system.
- It uses [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] for OTA (optional if you don't plan to
  integrate with OTA).

If your project diverges from these assumptions, please [get in
touch][get-in-touch]. It will likely still work without major changes.

## Getting Started

Take a look at our [getting-started guide][docs-linux-getting-started] to set up
your integration.

OTA/Release Management is currently fully supported through an off-the-shelf
integration with the SWUpdate agent. Read more about it in the [OTA integration
guide][docs-linux-ota].

Metrics are also supported through [collectd][collectd-homepage]. Read more
about it in the [Linux Metrics integration guide][docs-linux-metrics].

## Documentation and Features

- Detailed documentation for the Ticos Linux SDK can be found in our online
  docs: see the [introduction][docs-linux-introduction] and the [getting-started
  guide][docs-linux-getting-started].
- Visit our [features overview][docs-platform] for a generic introduction to all
  the major features of the Ticos platform.

[docs-linux-introduction]: https://docs.ticos.com/docs/linux/introduction
[docs-linux-getting-started]: https://ticos.io/linux-getting-started

An integration example can be found under
[`/meta-ticos-example`](/meta-ticos-example). The central part of the SDK
lives in a Yocto layer in [`/meta-ticos`](/meta-ticos).

### OTA Updates

To provide OTA Updates, the Ticos Cloud implements an API endpoint compatible
with the [hawkBit DDI API][hawkbit-ddi]. Various clients are available, but
`ticosd` supports [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] out of the box and is able to
configure it to talk to our hawkBit DDI-compatible endpoint.

### Metrics

The Ticos Linux SDK relies on [collectd][collectd-homepage] for the
collection and transmission of metrics. Application metrics can be sent to
collectd by means of [`statsd`][statsd-homepage].

### Crash Reports

To collect and upload user-land coredumps, the Ticos Linux SDK relies the
standard kernel [coredump][man-core] feature, and so does not need to make use
of any additional dependencies. Read more about [coredumps using the Ticos
Linux SDK][docs-linux-coredumps].

[man-core]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html

### Reboot Reason Tracking and Logs

These features are fully in the domain of `ticosd`. Note that logs are an
upcoming feature, while reboot reason tracking and crash reports are supported
today. Read more about [reboot reason tracking using the Ticos Linux
SDK][docs-reboots].
